# Document-Clustering
Given an input string query, our aim was to get as an output, a set of documents ordered by how relevant they are to the given input  query. We used the Cosine similarity measure to measure the relevance.

Here hello*.txt files are the custom test files.
(Input query can contain only those words which have already occured in the doucuments(i.e the test files))
